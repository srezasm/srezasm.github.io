> By my early thirties I saw the obvious: my smarts and "talent" - above average or not - would count for little unless I outworked most of the other writers. Only when I started putting in some extra hours did I get anywhere.
> Examine closely even the most extreme examples - Mozart, Newton, Einstein, Stravinsky - and you find more hard-won mastery than gift. Geniuses are made, not born.

Perhaps, a gene that's responsible for not getting frustrated easily is still at play.

> "These people don't necessarily have an especially high IQ, but they almost always have very **supportive environments**, and they almost always have **important mentors**. And the one thing they always have is this incredible investment of effort."

So still, as it's the matter of *non-equality* in intelligence that's causing people to get sad about their success, even if it's not the intelligence that's responsible for one's success, there are other factors that are, besides their hard-working characteristics.

**The world is not fair, and it's just the way it is.**

> Take intelligence. No accepted measure of innate or basic intelligence, whether IQ or other metrics, **reliably predicts** that a person will develop extraordinary ability.

In the complex systems, like society, this can't be a fair argument. Merely showing a higher probability of success is enough to say that IQ is important.
